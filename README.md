## Description
The point of the project is to create an app that displays food options for people that are either cutting or bulking

* We decided to make an app that would help individuals eat a variuety of foods while still keeping up with their cut or bulk progress

* As a group we decided to make a macro calculator type of app but with foods. Where they are given two images to click between whetehr its a cut or bulk

* For this project we decided to make our own API, along with the use of webpack, graphql, react, mogoDB, apolloserver, heroku etc. 

* The project was broken down into roles and parts between five members depednign on where people were most comfrotable. Two individuals were weking on the frontend, while the three others worked on the back end.

* So when the user is prompted to the site they have to sign up to the app and log in using their credentials.

* Once  they have logged in they will be presented wiht two images of food. One of them will be for cutting and the other will be for bulking.

* Once the user has selected the image they will then be brought to another page where where they will be given a variety of food depednign on what they decided to choose whether it was bulking or cutting.

* After the user has decided on the food they wanted they can clcik on the link to be directed to the recipe.

* Once the user gets what they need they are then able to go back to the home page sign out and then get to cooking.
